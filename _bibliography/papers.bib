  title={Boosting learning ability of overdamped bistable stochastic resonance system based physical reservoir computing model by time-delayed feedback.},
  author={Zhuozheng Shi and Zhiqiang Liao and Hitoshi Tabata},
  abstract={Physical reservoir computing (RC), which can be implemented by various physical systems, is a low-cost neuromorphic framework with a fast learning capability. In the previous studies, an overdamped bistable system-based RC (OBRC) inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model has been proposed to construct an outstanding physical RC system. Benefitting from the stochastic resonance effect, the OBRC requires less power and has stronger noise robustness than many conventional physical RC systems. However, compared with conventional physical RC systems, its learning ability is not superior. To boost the performance of the OBRC, we propose an OBRC with time-delayed feedback (TOBRC). In this work, the TOBRC is implemented in a physical setting with time-multiplexing nodes design and simulated on a conventional computer. Moreover, we adopt a powerful optimization algorithm to automatically determine the optimal hyperparameters for both the OBRC and TOBRC; thus, a more precise quantitative discussion on the upper limit of the system can be made. To compare the TOBRC and OBRC, we conducted short-term memory and parity check tasks to assess the short-term memory ability and nonlinearity, which are the two core abilities of physical RC for learning. The results prove that the short-term memory ability and nonlinearity of the proposed TOBRC are 6.46 and 2.15 times higher than those of the OBRC, respectively. Moreover, the TOBRC outperforms the OBRC under different noise conditions. On the MNIST handwritten digit recognition benchmark, the TOBRC exhibited a lower error rate than the OBRC; it was comparable with that of advanced physical RC systems. Our study confirms that the TOBRC can exhibit excellent learning ability in practical problems.},

  author={Bin Huang and Guozheng Wei and Bing Wang and Fusong Ju and Yi Zhong and Zhuozheng Shi and Shiwei Sun and Dongbo Bu},
  abstract={Our approach applies a sequential Bayesian updating technique to measure the similarity between optical maps and candidate contig paths. Using this similarity to guide path searching, our approach achieves higher accuracy than the existing "searching by evaluation" strategy that relies on heuristics. Furthermore, unlike the "searching followed by evaluation" strategy enumerating all possible paths, our approach prunes the unlikely sub-paths and extends the highly-probable ones only, thus significantly increasing searching efficiency.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
