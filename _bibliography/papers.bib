  title={Calibrated prediction intervals for polygenic scores across diverse contexts},
  author={Kangcheng Hou and Ziqi Xu and Yi Ding and Ravi Mandla and Zhuozheng Shi and Kristin Boulier and Arbel Harpak and Bogdan Pasaniuc},
  abstract={Polygenic scores (PGS) have emerged as the tool of choice for genomic prediction in a wide range of fields. We show that PGS performance varies broadly across contexts and biobanks. Contexts such as age, sex and income can impact PGS accuracy with similar magnitudes as genetic ancestry. Here we introduce an approach (CalPred) that models all contexts jointly to produce prediction intervals that vary across contexts to achieve calibration (include the trait with 90% probability), whereas existing methods are miscalibrated. In analyses of 72 traits across large and diverse biobanks (All of Us and UK Biobank), we find that prediction intervals required adjustment by up to 80% for quantitative traits. For disease traits, PGS-based predictions were miscalibrated across socioeconomic contexts such as annual household income levels, further highlighting the need of accounting for context information in PGS-based prediction across diverse populations.},

  title={Enhancing Performance of Convolutional Neural Network-Based Epileptic Electroencephalogram Diagnosis by Asymmetric Stochastic Resonance},
  author={Zhuozheng Shi and Zhiqiang Liao and Hitoshi Tabata},
  abstract={Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that leads to transient neurological dysfunction and is clinically diagnosed primarily by electroencephalography. Several intelligent systems have been proposed to automatically detect seizures, among which deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown better performance than traditional machine-learning algorithms. Owing to artifacts and noise, the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) must be preprocessed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio prior to being fed into the CNN classifier. However, because of the spectrum overlapping of uncontrollable noise with EEG, traditional filters cause information loss in EEG; thus, the potential of classifiers cannot be fully exploited. In this study, we propose a stochastic resonance-effect-based EEG preprocessing module composed of three asymmetrical overdamped bistable systems in parallel. By setting different asymmetries for the three parallel units, the inherent noise can be transferred to the different spectral components of the EEG through the asymmetric stochastic resonance effect. In this process, the proposed preprocessing module not only avoids the loss of information of EEG but also provides a CNN with high-quality EEG of diversified frequency information to enhance its performance. By combining the proposed preprocessing module with a residual neural network, we developed an intelligent diagnostic system for predicting seizure onset. The developed system achieved an average sensitivity of 98.96% on the CHB-MIT dataset and 95.45% on the Siena dataset, with a false prediction rate of 0.048/h and 0.033/h, respectively. In addition, a comparative analysis demonstrated the superiority of the developed diagnostic system with the proposed preprocessing module over other existing methods.},

  title={Boosting learning ability of overdamped bistable stochastic resonance system based physical reservoir computing model by time-delayed feedback.},
  author={Zhuozheng Shi and Zhiqiang Liao and Hitoshi Tabata},
  abstract={Physical reservoir computing (RC), which can be implemented by various physical systems, is a low-cost neuromorphic framework with a fast learning capability. In the previous studies, an overdamped bistable system-based RC (OBRC) inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model has been proposed to construct an outstanding physical RC system. Benefitting from the stochastic resonance effect, the OBRC requires less power and has stronger noise robustness than many conventional physical RC systems. However, compared with conventional physical RC systems, its learning ability is not superior. To boost the performance of the OBRC, we propose an OBRC with time-delayed feedback (TOBRC). In this work, the TOBRC is implemented in a physical setting with time-multiplexing nodes design and simulated on a conventional computer. Moreover, we adopt a powerful optimization algorithm to automatically determine the optimal hyperparameters for both the OBRC and TOBRC; thus, a more precise quantitative discussion on the upper limit of the system can be made. To compare the TOBRC and OBRC, we conducted short-term memory and parity check tasks to assess the short-term memory ability and nonlinearity, which are the two core abilities of physical RC for learning. The results prove that the short-term memory ability and nonlinearity of the proposed TOBRC are 6.46 and 2.15 times higher than those of the OBRC, respectively. Moreover, the TOBRC outperforms the OBRC under different noise conditions. On the MNIST handwritten digit recognition benchmark, the TOBRC exhibited a lower error rate than the OBRC; it was comparable with that of advanced physical RC systems. Our study confirms that the TOBRC can exhibit excellent learning ability in practical problems.},

  abstract={Our approach applies a sequential Bayesian updating technique to measure the similarity between optical maps and candidate contig paths. Using this similarity to guide path searching, our approach achieves higher accuracy than the existing "searching by evaluation" strategy that relies on heuristics. Furthermore, unlike the "searching followed by evaluation" strategy enumerating all possible paths, our approach prunes the unlikely sub-paths and extends the highly-probable ones only, thus significantly increasing searching efficiency.},

  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
