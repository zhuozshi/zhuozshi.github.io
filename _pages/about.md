I am a second-year master student in [the Department of Bioengineering](https://bioeng.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), [Graduate School of Engineering](https://www.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/soe), [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html), supervised by [Professor Hitoshi Tabata](http://www.bioxide.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/profile/).

I finished my undergraduate in [Computer Science](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/bs-computer-science) at UCSD in 2020, and I am joining [Bioinformatics PhD program](https://bioinformatics.ucla.edu) in UCLA in 2023.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
