I am a fisrt-year PhD student in [Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics.ucla.edu), University of California Los Angeles, currently rotating in [Bogdan Lab](https://bogdan.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/).


I received my M.S. degree in [Bioengineering](https://bioeng.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) at [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) in 2023, supervised by [Professor Hitoshi Tabata](http://www.bioxide.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/profile/). I completed my B.S. degree in [Computer Science](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/bs-computer-science) at UCSD in 2020.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
